Nice work! A couple of things:

1. In LightSwitch.java, line 33 has a ; after closing }.
Also, since this constructor isn't doing anything it should be deleted.

2. I'm curious about your choice of "on"/"off" and "open"/"close" as your choice of arguments
for your methods.

If this is service within your app, it probably won't pass any arguments at all. Instead,
it'll just change isLightOn to false if it's true, or change it to true if it's false
- same with the door.

On the other hand, if you're thinking of it as Alexa translating a verbal command into text,
you'd probably need to perform tasks with string arguments like "turn the light on" or "light on".

Your methods aren't incorrect - but I want to make sure you're thinking through how the complete
app would work rather than just the specific piece that you're working on.
